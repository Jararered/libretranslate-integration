# libretranslate-integration

A simple extension that calls libretranslate to translate text in the editor.

## Features

Supports translating selected text as well as inserting translations on a new line.

## Requirements

Currently the only requirement is to have libretranslate installed through pip:

```
pip install libretranslate
```

Once installed, make sure in a terminal that libretranslate is running by simply calling it:

```
libretranslate
```

And you should see the following service running on port 5000 by default. (This is hard-coded at the moment.)

```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
